# Low-Grade-Glioma-Segmentation

## A. Business Understanding

This is a project on a real dataset related to segmenting low-grade glioma. [Here is the Jupyter Notebook] (https://github.com/Abirouk/Low-Grade-Glioma-Segmentation/blob/main/Low-grade-glioma-segmentation.ipynb)

### A.1 What is the low-grade glioma?

Low-grade glioma is a type of brain tumor that is classified as a grade II and III tumor on the World Health Organization (WHO) grading scale and arises from the supporting cells of the brain called glial cells. They are generally benign but can cause significant neurological symptoms as they grow and put pressure on the surrounding brain tissue. They are most common in adults, but can also occur in children. These tumors are typically treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or a combination of both. In some cases, they may also be observed with close monitoring if the patient is asymptomatic. It is important to note that low-grade gliomas can progress over time to higher-grade tumors, so patients need to undergo regular monitoring to detect any changes in the tumor.

Low-grade glioma segmentation is the process of identifying and separating the tumor tissue from the surrounding healthy tissue in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain.

### Why deep learning should be used?

Deep learning has proven to be an effective tool for this task, as it allows for the accurate identification of tumor boundaries in MRI scans. Without the use of deep learning, segmentation of low-grade gliomas can be difficult, time-consuming, and subject to inter- and intra-observer variability, as it often requires manual annotation by radiologists. However, the segmentation of low-grade glioma can be challenging due to their infiltrative nature and similarity in appearance to surrounding brain tissue. Additionally, traditional methods may not be as accurate as deep learning, leading to potential misdiagnosis and improper treatment.
    As a result, there is a need for accurate and efficient methods for low-grade glioma segmentation to improve patient outcomes. Deep learning-based solutions can improve the efficiency and accuracy of low-grade glioma segmentation, leading to better patient outcomes and cost savings for healthcare providers.
